# A-Hybrid-Deep-Learning-Framework-for-Real-Time-Weapon-Detection-on-an-Embedded-Vision-Platform
This project focuses on the design and development of a low-cost, intelligent surveillance system capable of real-time weapon detection using an embedded vision platform. The system addresses the limitations of traditional CCTV-based surveillance, which relies heavily on human operators and suffers from attention fatigue, delayed response, and high false-negative risk during critical security events.

The proposed solution uses an ESP32-CAM–based mobile robotic platform as a lightweight edge sensing unit. Due to the computational constraints of microcontrollers, the system adopts a computation offloading (fog computing) architecture, where captured image frames are transmitted over Wi-Fi to a local server. This server performs deep learning inference using a custom-trained YOLOv10 object detection model optimized for firearm detection. Detected weapons are annotated with bounding boxes and confidence scores and displayed on a real-time Streamlit-based dashboard for human supervision.

The project experimentally demonstrates that high-accuracy weapon detection (confidence > 0.85) is achievable using ultra-low-cost hardware when combined with server-side inference. However, results also reveal a key trade-off: the use of HTTP-based image streaming introduces network latency (~500–600 ms), limiting the effective frame rate to around 5–6 FPS. Despite this, the system remains suitable for monitoring and early threat awareness in indoor environments.

Beyond technical implementation, the project critically evaluates ethical, legal, and privacy considerations, including GDPR compliance, algorithmic bias, and the risks of automation-driven decision-making. Overall, the work validates the feasibility of democratizing AI-powered security systems by combining embedded IoT devices with modern deep learning through offloading architectures, while also identifying clear pathways for future optimization such as WebSockets, encrypted communication, and autonomous response integration.
